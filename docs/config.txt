Rails works with three modes of operation:
1) development
2) test
3) production
Here you set, on which database to connect, reload on each request, use caching...
These setting can be found in environments folder

Bundler
- helps manage applications gem dependencies
- all settings are found in the Gemfile located at the root
- gems can be grouped by adding group clause (test, development)
- gem version can be specified by adding version number
- gems can be added from :git => , and filesystem :path =>
- after every change to Gemfile >>bundle install<< should be run

Boot.rb, Application.rb and Environment.rb
1) boot.rb sets up bundler and load paths
2) application.rb loads:
   - rails gems
   - gems for current environemt
   - configuration
   You can add other classes to the load path except Models, Controllers etc
   You can set timezone, observers, localization
   Specific intialaziations can have their specific files in config/initializers like:
    - backrtace silencers - remove backtraces that don't matter to you (Hbase)
    - cookie initilaztion key
    - inflections - specific types for pluralization for example our words
    - custom mime types - response for specific mime types e.g jar
    - session store - cookey, memcached ....
    - log levels
3) environment.rb initializer

Log folder is where log files dependad of your environment are stored
tail -f log/development.log
Rails::Subscriber.colorize_logging weather to colorize statements or not
