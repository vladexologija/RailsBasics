Rails works with three modes of operation:
- development
- test
- production
Here you set, on which database to connect, reload on each request, use caching...
These setting can be found in environments folder

Bundler
- helps manage applications gem dependencies
- all settings are found in the Gemfile located at the root
- gems can be grouped by adding group clause (test, development)
- gem version can be specified by adding version number
- gems can be added from :git => , and filesystem :path =>
- after every change to Gemfile >>bundle install<< should be run
